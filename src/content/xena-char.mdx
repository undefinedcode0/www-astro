## Overview

Xena is a dealer on the outskirts of Russia, living off of cybernetic augments. Once a normal human, now lives with neurotech and biomechanical implants. Struggling to balance street work with their traumatizing past. They were supposed to be dead, but now have been brought back with neuro tech and biomechanical implants. They still have their full consciousness, and now find themselves more aware of their surroundings than usual.

## Key Incident

On a solo mission, Xena walked into a place heavily rigged with explosives by their enemies. They felt an uneasy silence in the atmosphere, yet still continued alone just to get done with this mission... then BOOM! The explosion hurled their back six feet into a wall, knocking them out cold. Shrapnel from the explosives teared through their vital organs. Everything happened all at once, they suffered from major blood loss, woke up on a table where they were operated on. They never wanted the neurotech, but she was forced to endure the surgery due to a contract she had signed when she became a dealer. They saw that the surgeons made experiments on them... Because of this, they refuse solo missions and require a partner or backup team. Due to their injuries, they cannot feel part of their face, more specifically their left eye.

## Hobbies

- They enjoy going on long walks, often venturing far since they’ve already explored most of the surrounding land.
- They love collecting tees (mineral wash, charcoal, trash poetry design, cyber, etc.) that stand out to them (urban fashion style).
- They spend most of their free time at the arcade.

## Past Life

In their younger years, when they were in school, they struggled to socialize with their peers and didn't participate much. They were always called out for being a "weird kid" because "they didn't act like other girls." School counselors tried to recommend their parents' programs to enroll her in, but none worked for their because "all of it is the same bullshit like always."
