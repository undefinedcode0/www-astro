  - Along the tail are **sleek spikes** highlighted with the **red glow** (possibly nanite acid or related to her abilities)
  - Wires loosen as they approach the base of a **large, highly complex barb-like end**, also carrying the same highlights throughout - this can **function as a weapon** (and may carry other functions)

- **Features**:
  - **Neon red eyes**
  - **Long dark slightly frizzy red hair** with blunt bangs
  - **Left eye that doubles as a screen** for system monitoring and status checks
